Skipped Pets:
    fish - need to implement check for level up that will call a level up method on a  pet and call the shop 
    horse

Pets to fix:
    Flamingo currently assumes it is the first pet in the vec, needs to assume it is the idx pet

ML things to do:
    Force model to learn rules by giving it negative reward until it picks valid choice
    Make a batch size so that it plays batch size number of games before updating policy
    One hot encode the categorical elements of the game state
