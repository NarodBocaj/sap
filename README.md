Attempting to create an neural net with reinforcement learning to play the base "turtle pack" of Super Auto Pets.

The Rust src creates a python dylib which is the libsap.so file that provides the Super Auto Pets environment for torch to have some fun with.

Very few of the pet and food methods are implemented so far but they are all there as well as basic battling.
